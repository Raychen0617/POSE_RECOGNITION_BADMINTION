# this is not the full code it's mainly for backup usage 

'Openpose', human pose estimation algorithm, have been implemented using Tensorflow. It also provides several variants that have some changes to the network structure for **real-time processing on the CPU or low-power embedded devices.**

**You can even run this on your macbook with a descent FPS!**

Implemented features are listed here : [features](./etcs/feature.md)

## My Updates
- 2020 - 10  Add newrunvideo.py 
- 2020 - 10  Output keypoints as csv files
- 2020 - 11  Apply player tracking in estimator.py
- 2020 - 11  Update player tracking in estimator.py
- 2020 - 12 - 20   Done background submission and bitwise in file Background_subtraction


## Install

### Dependencies

You need dependencies below.

- python3
- tensorflow 1.4.1+
- opencv3, protobuf, python3-tk
- slidingwindow
  - https://github.com/adamrehn/slidingwindow
  - I copied from the above git repo to modify few things.

### Install

Clone the repo and install 3rd-party libraries.

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation
$ cd tf-pose-estimation
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Build c++ library for post processing. See : https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation/tree/master/tf_pose/pafprocess
```
$ cd tf_pose/pafprocess
$ swig -python -c++ pafprocess.i && python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Package Install

Alternatively, you can install this repo as a shared package using pip.

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation
$ cd tf-pose-estimation
$ python setup.py install  # Or, `pip install -e .`
```

### Download Tensorflow Graph File(pb file)

Before running demo, you should download graph files. You can deploy this graph on your mobile or other platforms.

- cmu (trained in 656x368)
- mobilenet_thin (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_large (trained in 432x368)
- mobilenet_v2_small (trained in 432x368)

CMU's model graphs are too large for git, so I uploaded them on an external cloud. You should download them if you want to use cmu's original model. Download scripts are provided in the model folder.

```
$ cd models/graph/cmu
$ bash download.sh
```

## Python Usage

### Realtime Webcam

```
$ python run_webcam.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 --camera=0
```

Apply TensoRT 

```
$ python run_webcam.py --model=mobilenet_thin --resize=432x368 --camera=0 --tensorrt=True
```

### run video
```
python3 newrunvideo.py --model=mobilenet_thin --video=./images/2.mp4 --write_video=./results.mp4
```
